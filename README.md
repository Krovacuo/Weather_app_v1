# Weather_app_v1
A simple weather app

This is a project i've been working for sometime, while i learn more things about web development.
So i've been using most of the things i learned so far in here as you can see it's still a work in progress,
since i will keep adding more features as i learn more things.

This purpose of this app is to check the weather and forecast of a city, right now it does the job, but it still
needs more work, some of the features i plan to are an autocomplete feature for the search, a better looking UI.

An the final steps would be to port it to framework like angular or react and make use of a database like Mongodb or
cloud firestore.

The concepts or tools it uses as of now are:
<ul>
  <li>CSS3 flexbox</li>
  <li>The html5 semantic tags</li>
  <li>Asynchronous Javascript</li>
  <li>Web Storage(localstorage) API</li>
  <li>ES6 features(arrow functions, closures, IIFE, fetch API)</li>
  <li>MVC pattern</li>
</ul>


Thanks a lot for reading and have a nice day.<br>
